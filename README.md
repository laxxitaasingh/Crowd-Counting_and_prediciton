# Crowd-Counting_and_prediciton

This repository provides an implementation of crowd counting and prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Crowd counting and prediction are essential tasks in computer vision with various applications such as crowd management, surveillance, and urban planning.

## Features
* Crowd Counting: The repository includes a CNN-based crowd counting model that can estimate the number of people in a crowd. It takes an input image and produces a density map that represents the crowd density distribution.

* Crowd Prediction: In addition to counting, the repository also offers a CNN-based crowd prediction model. This model takes a sequence of crowd images as input and predicts the future crowd density distribution. It is useful for anticipating crowd behavior and planning accordingly.

* Dataset Utilities: The repository provides utilities to preprocess and augment crowd counting datasets. It includes functions for data loading, data augmentation, and density map generation. These utilities facilitate the training and evaluation of crowd counting and prediction models.

* Evaluation Metrics: To assess the performance of the models, the repository offers evaluation metrics commonly used in crowd counting tasks. These metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and F1-score.




## Usage
Refer to the documentation and examples provided in the repository to learn how to use the crowd counting and prediction models. It includes code snippets and explanations for training, inference, and evaluation.
